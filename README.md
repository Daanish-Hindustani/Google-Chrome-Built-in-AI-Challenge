# Resume AI Agents Using CrewAI And Google Gemini Pro LLM Models
 


## Description
- An Crew of AI Agents which take in a resume critique it then rewrite it and finally formate it with proper ats key words. 
- These agents also have the ability to look online for relevant infomation about a job posting, its decription, and even infomation on how to build 
  a good resume for a specifc career.
- There are two agents a reader and writter, the reader agents reads the resume and impoves it(ATS,grammer,consisness,decription,etc.).
    The second agent is the write, given some text input from the other agent with the corrected resume and context the writter agent creates a html file
    with the changes and formats it properly. 
- HTML->PDF conversion, because Google gemini doesn't have pdf generation I used a pdf_to_html module to create the pdf file.
